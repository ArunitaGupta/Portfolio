        <p>
          I have represented my school in numerous competitions and olympiads. I
          received the Gold Medal for achieving excellence in academics for six
          consecutive years. I have always had a knack for logical reasoning,
          mathematical problems and coding which led to me choosing Computer
          Science as my major. I love solving algorithms and enjoy understanding
          the logic behind everything. I enjoy tons of other hobbies which
          include dancing, playing badminton and table tennis, solving puzzles
          like sudoku and crossword. I am also an avid reader.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the achievements front, I have been awarded the top positions of
          Vedic Math National competitions for three years. In olympiads like
          National Math Olympiad, National Science Olympiad, and National Search
          for Talent Examination, I have reached successive rounds and have had
          ranks in the top 20. I cracked IIT JEE-Advanced 2018. I have completed
          80+ hours of Community Service with various NGOs.
